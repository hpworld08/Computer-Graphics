# Computer-Graphics
Zbuffer (Depth Buffer) algorithm and other CG algorithm using Glut library in C++  

INTRODUCTION 
It is difficult to find codes for some of the Computer Graphics  algorithms in language like C or C++.In this project we implement those algorithm which one can use for future reference

OBJECTIVES
 To develop a interactive program using the OpenGl and C language to implement Computer Graphics algorithms

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
The program enables the user to select algorithm of his/her  choice.
Each choice enables a function which in turn executes the requested algorithm.
Z-Buffer Algorithm


 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
•	Code Blocks
•	Language used : C 
•	Libraries : OpenGL


CONCLUSION 
Thus this the program helps in understanding Computer Graphics in a more practical way. It can be further modified as per requirement.
